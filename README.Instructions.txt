Thank you for taking the time to review my coding submission. 

The code is split up into files, one for each class and then the main file. 

This was written in Python 3.6, so can be run on any IDE supporting Python v3.6 onwards. 

The program will prompt you to set the start coordinates, such as 5 5 (X,Y)

You will then be asked how many rovers you would like to track, for exmaple 2

For each rover in turn, you will be asked for their start coordinates and direction, such as 0 0 N

You will then be asked to input the move instructions, either with or without spaces, such as MMRMM or m m r m l

You can then choose to test additional rovers or view they journeys of one or all of your rovers

The inputs are not case sensitive
